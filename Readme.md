Working logic of the project:

1- "ddl.py" file has to work once. It creates database tables and writes the fields to the spreadsheet

2- insert_data(): works with all APIs, inserts data to database and spreatsheet.

Note:You should add the client_services.json with your own google credentials. 
You should share the document with the "client_email" to be able to edit it.
