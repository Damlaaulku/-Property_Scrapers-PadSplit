They aren't always helpful. I wish they cared more about the parents. We are concerned parents. We have rights. We should be able to communicate with one another and voice our opinions. We should feel comfortable asking for help. I think this school would be better if parents were treated with respect . Also, there's not much going on for the students. No after school activities, there was boy scouts and soccer for a while..but it was for boys only. There also hasn't been school program, Where we as parents could watch our children perform. We are missing out on school memories. There could be fundraisers like movie nights like they do at other schools to raise money. Scarborough Elementary needs changes.",

I felt like I was being judged for everything as a parent, my kids hated school, it was not a welcome friendly environment. My children were struggling in school. My son is Special Needs. I was expected to be the teacher. I paid out of pocket for testing tutors because school refused. They LOVE Worsham. My kids are not singled out and they are getting the help they need. The staff is friendly. Everyone is treated Respectfully and I feel welcome and comfortable here. I drive 30 minutes from Atascocita there and back twice a day out of district and its worth it. I honestly can say I highly recommend Worsham elementary. I only wish my kids could have started here in kindergarten and avoided all the drama early on. I am grateful for this school. They are amazing!",

When needing information about school activities and dates. Everyone seems to play the i don't know card and let me give you a call back(and no one calls back). The majority of parents work a full time job and we need dates ahead of time to put in and be off for that events. They want to let everyone know a week before the event is taking place and change the time for the event two to three times in less than two weeks. Another issues, Teachers aren't supplied with the necessary things in order to keep us informed. The lack paper or so I was told by my little ones pre k teacher. They don't send conduct cards like they used to back then. They don't send home a curriculum of what they are being taught. So basically you have to try and get it out of your 5yr old and see what all was done. It's frustrating!!",

The principal is holed up in his office all day and refuses to have any contact with parents unless forced. IT is obvious that he does not like children by his lack of interaction with them. He is weak. The office staff is extremely unprofessional. The only reason this school is somewhat effective is because of the dedication of the teachers. Parental involvement is discouraged and there is no PTA or parental organization. In fact, I have been treated rudely and turned away by the office staff on many occasions. I attended this school when Jane Walker was principal and the morale was so much better. I am moving so my children can go to Lyohns elementary which is an excellent school.",

Also, most of the staff is very irresponsible. My kids' education level has deteriated since moving to that school and some parents said the same thing about their kids. I had to move my kids out of there after their first year. If your kids attend any intermediate school in Aldine, the best ones happen to be Parker, Reed, and Eckert.",

Also, most of the staff is very irresponsible. My kids' education level has deteriated since moving to that school and some parents said the same thing about their kids. I had to move my kids out of there after their first year. If your kids attend any intermediate school in Aldine, the best ones happen to be Parker, Reed, and Eckert.",

They aren't always helpful. I wish they cared more about the parents. We are concerned parents. We have rights. We should be able to communicate with one another and voice our opinions. We should feel comfortable asking for help. I think this school would be better if parents were treated with respect . Also, there's not much going on for the students. No after school activities, there was boy scouts and soccer for a while..but it was for boys only. There also hasn't been school program, Where we as parents could watch our children perform. We are missing out on school memories. There could be fundraisers like movie nights like they do at other schools to raise money. Scarborough Elementary needs changes.",

College is greatly supported and many are encouraged to have the help of teachers, counselors, and the Go Center. We arent perfect, but anyone wanting to get an education can get one.",

We have the \"Go Center\" that provides information for us to go to college. They also help us so that we can take out SAT without having to pay. We should get recognized for the good stuff not the bad!",

Administration concentrates more on taking kids hats and making sure students are in dress code than making sure they are doing good in class. Students are very disrespectful and rude and don't care about literally anything. I know we are teen but most students just can't tell what is right and what is wrong. I know this to be true because teacher look on in disbelief. Gang violence and pride is very big in this school, they made the mistake of not shutting this school down 5 years ago. Do not ever take your child here. You will regret it. It will be very difficult for you here if you want to learn and make good friends. It is very sad and broken here.",

The SAT is a major college admission determining factor and the students had to take it with construction noises all around during the entire test time. Construction has been in progress around the school for months, so it was a known factor. One call from the school principal to HISD or from the HISD superintendent to the mayor could have eliminated the noise for the 5 hours of testing. Or the school could have provided an alternative examination site -- like, for instance, having the 200 students take the SAT at Bellaire High School where the school had numerous empty classrooms because Bellaire asked their 3,000+ freshmen, sophomores, and seniors to arrive to school late on the testing date to provide their juniors with quiet for testing. One instance of HSPVA's top administration's lack of consideration and respect for their students.",

Be prepared to suffer through the trials that your kid will experience such as extreme competition, immediate shock to self-esteem within the first year, constant schedule juggling, prima donna micro-manager instructors, constant practicing, summer school, senior recital prep, some level of outside-of-the-class isolation, obvious cliques, and some level of apathy from the school when it comes to college. The school expects that if your son or daughter is going there, the child should have a higher level of maturity when it comes to determining the college to attend, major, etc. HSPVA is mainly focused on the here and now as a college prepatory program for the arts. So, there is sort of a take no prisoners attitude there. If your kid doesn't cut it in the first year academically/ arts, they are out. Thats it. The best thing a kid will get coming out of there is mental toughness and learning to stay focused on achieving set goals in the face of schedule constraints and adversity. Overall, it is a good school but it is not a cakewalk.",

I am delighted my daughter had the opportunity to attend and will graduate from this school in 2013. Not for the weak hearted, you have to work hard, stick to it and earn respect in your art area. This school has encouraged my daughter to be a wonderful dancer and to take the most academically challenging classes. Excellent balance between art and academics.",

We all know the evaluation of dance is subjective but one has to seriously question a department which finds 0% growth in a student whom outside organizations consistently give high marks. The dept. is more concerned with producing PVA-bots than well- trained dancers. The teachers tear down students self-esteem by telling them they are fat, are not cut out for dance, their choreography is horrible, have not shown improvement and by threatening to kick them out. Dance classes are like an episode Beverly Hills 90210 where groups of students have one set of rules and expectations and others another. I haven t yet figured out how students succeed in the dance department but I know it s not by dancing well. You d do better at Carver or the Houston Ballet.",

They aren't always helpful. I wish they cared more about the parents. We are concerned parents. We have rights. We should be able to communicate with one another and voice our opinions. We should feel comfortable asking for help. I think this school would be better if parents were treated with respect . Also, there's not much going on for the students. No after school activities, there was boy scouts and soccer for a while..but it was for boys only. There also hasn't been school program, Where we as parents could watch our children perform. We are missing out on school memories. There could be fundraisers like movie nights like they do at other schools to raise money. Scarborough Elementary needs changes.",

Many have stayed after donating time to help ones who need a little bit of help. They are a bit strict but it is to help us, not hurt. Many have successfully graduated and more will as time goes on. College is greatly supported and many are encouraged to have the help of teachers, counselors, and the Go Center. We arent perfect, but anyone wanting to get an education can get one.",

Administration concentrates more on taking kids hats and making sure students are in dress code than making sure they are doing good in class. Students are very disrespectful and rude and don't care about literally anything. I know we are teen but most students just can't tell what is right and what is wrong. I know this to be true because teacher look on in disbelief. Gang violence and pride is very big in this school, they made the mistake of not shutting this school down 5 years ago. Do not ever take your child here. You will regret it. It will be very difficult for you here if you want to learn and make good friends. It is very sad and broken here.",

The SAT is a major college admission determining factor and the students had to take it with construction noises all around during the entire test time. Construction has been in progress around the school for months, so it was a known factor. One call from the school principal to HISD or from the HISD superintendent to the mayor could have eliminated the noise for the 5 hours of testing. Or the school could have provided an alternative examination site -- like, for instance, having the 200 students take the SAT at Bellaire High School where the school had numerous empty classrooms because Bellaire asked their 3,000+ freshmen, sophomores, and seniors to arrive to school late on the testing date to provide their juniors with quiet for testing. One instance of HSPVA's top administration's lack of consideration and respect for their students.",

Be prepared to suffer through the trials that your kid will experience such as extreme competition, immediate shock to self-esteem within the first year, constant schedule juggling, prima donna micro-manager instructors, constant practicing, summer school, senior recital prep, some level of outside-of-the-class isolation, obvious cliques, and some level of apathy from the school when it comes to college. The school expects that if your son or daughter is going there, the child should have a higher level of maturity when it comes to determining the college to attend, major, etc. HSPVA is mainly focused on the here and now as a college prepatory program for the arts. So, there is sort of a take no prisoners attitude there. If your kid doesn't cut it in the first year academically/ arts, they are out. Thats it. The best thing a kid will get coming out of there is mental toughness and learning to stay focused on achieving set goals in the face of schedule constraints and adversity. Overall, it is a good school but it is not a cakewalk.",

We all know the evaluation of dance is subjective but one has to seriously question a department which finds 0% growth in a student whom outside organizations consistently give high marks. The dept. is more concerned with producing PVA-bots than well- trained dancers. The teachers tear down students self-esteem by telling them they are fat, are not cut out for dance, their choreography is horrible, have not shown improvement and by threatening to kick them out. Dance classes are like an episode Beverly Hills 90210 where groups of students have one set of rules and expectations and others another. I haven t yet figured out how students succeed in the dance department but I know it s not by dancing well. You d do better at Carver or the Houston Ballet.",
